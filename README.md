### About game
The Emperor Penguin takes a wild plunge into the Arctic Ocean during an epic ice slide.
Now, our feathery hero faces the challenge of making its way up to the snowy haven, 
located at a tantalizing distance. But wait, the journey won't be a leisurely swim! 
Brace yourself for thrilling encounters with cunning sharks, 
and master the art of escape to ensure the penguin's safe ascent to the snowy summit.
